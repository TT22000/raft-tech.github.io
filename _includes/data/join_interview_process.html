		<li>If feedback from the phone screening is positive, we schedule a 1 hour video conference call or in-person interview with our engineering team. We have an open conversation about technology, problems we're working on, and collaboratively work on a problem to gauge your problem solving skills.</li>
		<li>If feedback from the interview is positive, we schedule a call to go over the benefits package, compensation, etc.</li>
	</ul>
