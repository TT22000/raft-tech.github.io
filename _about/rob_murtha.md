about: Prior to joining the Raft family, Rob served in the U.S. Army as an Intelligence Operator with multiple deployments to Afghanistan, and worked for the FBI's Technology Innovation Office (TIO) before joining the Air Force’s Kessel Run team as a government civilian contributing to the JADC2 program and supporting critical, rapid software development operations. At Kessel Run, Rob really enjoyed his time as a designer on product teams, building solutions for the Air Operations Center, before transitioning to an advisor and liaison leadership role. Rob also supported the digital launch of the United States Veterans Chamber of Commerce; a 501©3 helping transitioning veterans and their families with access to employment, education and business opportunities, and co-founded a landscaping software startup "Grassly" when not too busy cheering for his (inexplicably) favorite team, the Jacksonville Jaguars.
