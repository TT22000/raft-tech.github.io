about: Hello! I'm joining Raft as a Product Manager. I have held numerous roles helping companies deliver software products to users. Most recently, I was a user experience architect, and before that, I was a solution delivery professional. While the roles and titles have been different, what it really comes down to is that I love to help people, connect dots, and solve tough problems while having a bit of fun. I find the most success when I work with people who align to a common goal, and I'm very excited about what Raft is doing.

I live in Iowa with my husband, 2 sons, and a crazy dog. I have lived in Iowa the majority of my life, but I have a passion for mountain air, and most vacations I take involve going somewhere with good hiking. I am a Peloton enthusiast, love movies and audiobooks (always looking for recommendations!), enjoy cooking and baking, and being outside as much as possible. I believe a good laugh can change any situation.
