about: Jack is a fullstack software developer who is constantly working to build a more accessible and enjoyable user experience. His background includes stints on archaeological digs to bartending, before diving into software development. Through all of them he learned to cue in on the human experience and now applies that to building a more inclusive web. His technological focus is on all things JavaScript particularly in React, Node.js, Rails and visualization libraries, but is always excited to dive into something new. When not at the keyboard he can be found enjoying the mountains with family and friends or at home listening to old vinyls and playing the drums.
