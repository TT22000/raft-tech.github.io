As the week of 4th of July approaches, I have been thinking a lot about what it means to be living in the land of the free and home of the brave. I came to this country with a dream to live my life where gender was not a basis of differentiation, and where all were treated equally no matter where they came from. This dream was the start of my journey of feeling empowered as a woman and empowering other women to accomplish what we set out to be, and to achieve what we always dreamt of without judgment on what is acceptable or “lady-like.” As a mother, wife, minority, immigrant, scientist, lawyer, and women entrepreneur, I have never taken independence for granted. I salute all the women of this country who have worked to earn the right to serve in the jury of their “peers.” When representing a women-owned business in a meeting, event, or a conference, I always remember that it is not about me per say. It is bigger than me. It is about all the women entrepreneurs out there who are continuously fighting against the odds for an equal platform to perform. Each day I am grateful to all the women who have worked hard in the hopes of having a society where women are not judged when we speak our mind, and to be respected and taken seriously in leadership positions. Have we come a long way since the Civil Rights Act? Yes. Is there a long way ahead to true equality? Yes.  

## What makes Raft different?

Every day I teach my kids to speak up when they see something wrong, to be honest, and to be confident rather than compliant. These are the same principles I have applied and continue to apply in building Raft. We, at Raft, are radically transparent, understand making mistakes is a part of growing, and are always learning. We have purposefully chosen to have a flat structure where there are no “bosses'' and everyone is committed to a one and only one goal—improving the lives of our fellow Americans. When we hire, we make a conscious choice to increase diversity, hire like-minded individuals who want to make an impact, and find those who view the hours they spend at work as more than just a job. I am often asked what differentiates us. I always respond that our super power is our culture and diversity. I am always proud to share the high percentage of women and minorities in our workforce. We at Raft, have it in our DNA to be diverse. Diversity is not a hashtag for us; rather it is the way we do things because we know it is the right thing to do.  

What differentiates us from the stereotypical beltway bubble is not just our focus on forward leaning technologies, but rather, the attitude of each of our team members. We don’t have A and B teams; we only have A teams. We check our ego at the door and we contribute; we roll up our sleeves, get the job done, and create impactful and accessible outcomes. We own our client problems and create solutions that embody the hacker ethos – open-source-first, transparency, and collaborative contribution.  

## Looking to the future

We are grateful to be supporting the mission of our partner agencies who have trusted us not because of our network or who we know, but rather, because of our technical and delivery merit. At Raft, we devote ourselves to changing the lives of our fellow Americans for the better. I am proud of what our team has achieved and of our dreams to continue to make an impact.  

Having built a growing minority woman-owned digital services company from a one-woman show, I know first-hand how hard it is to build a company without a network or mentorship. I am thankful for being able to have a platform to help others. This and every fourth of July is very personal to me. I am reminded of the sacrifices made and how we, at Raft, are fortunate to create a meaningful impact. Finally, this note is dedicated to my fellow Rafters who work hard each day to drive our mission forward. It is also dedicated to other women entrepreneurs, who may be a one-woman show right now, but are committed to being the driving force of the future.
